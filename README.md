# Wordpress Lockout
This plugin prevents defined users from logging into Wordpress when the CMS is 'locked'.

A set of users to 'lock out' can be defined in the `WP Admin > Settings > Wordpress Lockout` menu. They will not be locked out
however unless the CMS has also been 'locked' via the global switch in the `WP Admin > Settings > Wordpress Lockout` menu
